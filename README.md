# FBLA-Ebusiness-2015

This was my entry for the 2015 FBLA E-business Event. The topic was to create a website for a young artistic entrepreneur to sell their products online. This website received 3rd place in California and was a finalist (top 15) in the nation. See it in action at http://sketchception2015.meteor.com!
